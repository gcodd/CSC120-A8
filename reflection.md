Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

  My class represents a fairy. I included five final static class fields, MAX_HEIGHT, MIN_HEIGHT, MAX_COLLECT, MAX_ENERGY, and MIN_ENERGY. I made these fields static and final so they would hold the same value across all instances of the Fairy class. These final static variables set the possible range of other class fields such as energy, height, and size of the fairy's collection.
  
  
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
  
  The additional methods I implemented are as follows:
    + Fairy() default constructor
    + Fairy(name) constructor with name only
    + Fairy(height) constructor with height only
    + Fairy(name, height) full constructor
    + getHeight() height accessor
    + getName() name accessor
    + nCollection() accessor for size of collection
    + getEnergy() accessor for energy level
    + setName(name) manipulator for name 
    + showOptions() displays interactive options to user
    + printCollection() prints items in the fairy's collection


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

  Honestly, for assignments like this, I wish I just had more time to work on them. I would have loved to implement a main method that made this class totally interactive. I wish I had time to code a loop so the user could continuously choose which actions it wanted the fairy to take. I suppose that is a a task for the final project, though! I also wish I had time to get a little more creative with the other methods I implemented. 
  
  To someone taking this class in the future I would tell them to feel free to be creative but to not get stuck overcomplicating things! This is an issue I run into all the time and end up just having to tell myself "no" over and over again for the sake of time.
